# Patients-Condition-Classification-Using-drug-Review

I've just wrapped up an innovative project focused on -
 Patient Condition Classification
 using NLP techniques applied to a Drug Review dataset. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing, I've developed a system that not only classifies patient symptoms into potential diseases but also RECOMMENDS the top 3 drugs based on consumer ratings.

Imagine this: a platform where new patients can simply input their symptoms, and voil√†, our model predicts potential diseases and suggests the most effective drugs, all based on real consumer experiences.

In a world where the doctor-to-patient ratio is often imbalanced, especially in critical times, having a preliminary tool like this can be immensely valuable. It's not about replacing medical professionals but rather about providing an accessible resource for initial guidance and support.

Your feedback is incredibly valuable! Please feel free to comment with your suggestions, and don't hesitate to DM me if you're interested in exploring the code or collaborating.
